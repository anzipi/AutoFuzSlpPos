# Welcome to AutoFuzSlpPos
==========
----------
AutoFuzSlpPos (short for "**Automated Extraction of Fuzzy Slope Position**") is developed by PhD candidate Liangjun Zhu and **Prof.** Chengzhi Qin.

AutoFuzSlpPos is designed to extract fuzzy slope position information in hillslope scale based on the method proposed by Qin et al.(2009) and Qin et al.(2012).

AutoFuzSlpPos is based on [TauDEM](http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html) parallelized framework and submitted to TauDEM LICENSE.

Several functions of TauDEM are used to accomplish the preprocessing from DEM, include `Pitremove`, `D8FlowDir`, `DinfFlowDir`, `AreaD8`, `Threshold`, `MoveOutletsToStreams`, `AreaDinf`, `DinfDistDown`.

Also, some functions revised from TauDEM are developed, include `D8DistDownToStream`, `D8DistUpToRidge`, `DinfDistUpToRidge`.

Besides, new functions are designed, include `Curvature`, `SelectTypLocSlpPos`, `FuzzySlpPosInference` and `HardenSlpPos`.

AutoFuzSlpPos is programmed using C++ and Python. It can be compiled by Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows and GCC 4.7+ compiler on Linux/Unix. 

We have tested on Windows 7, CentOS 6.2 and Ubuntu 14.04. 
## INSTALLATION
------
### **1. Compile with CMAKE and nmake (Visual Studio) on Windows Platform**

  + Check the MPI Library path in CMakeLists.txt to make sure they are correct for your environment.
~~~
i.e.
include_directories("C:/Program Files/Microsoft HPC Pack 2012/Inc")
link_directories("C:/Program Files/Microsoft HPC Pack 2012/Lib/i386")
link_libraries("C:/Program Files/Microsoft HPC Pack 2012/Lib/i386/msmpi.lib")
~~~
  + From Start menu, run "Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)" as administrator.
~~~
cd <Destination_Build_Path>
cmake <Source_Path>
i.e. 
cd C:\AutoFuzSlpPos\build
cmake C:\AutoFuzSlpPos\src
~~~
  This will this will generate Visual Studio Project. Then you can edit or compile through VS.
  + As an alternative selection, We recommend this method to compile executable files directly.
~~~
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" <Source_Path>
nmake
~~~

### **2. Compile with makefile on Linux/Unix Platform**
+ compile [MPICH](http://www.mpich.org/downloads/)
+ Check the MPI_DIR in makefile to make sure it is correct for you.
~~~
i.e.
MPI_DIR = /home/zhulj/mpich/
~~~
+ Then, type this
~~~
cd <Soource_Path/src>
make
~~~
+ By default, the executable file will be located in `../exec_linux_x86`. You can change `INSTALLDIR` to control it.
~~~
i.e.
INSTALLDIR=../exec_linux_x86
