# 1 Introduction

AutoFuzSlpPos is an automatic approach with only one required input data (i.e., a gridded DEM of the study area) to deriving fuzzy slope positions based on the prototype-based inference method proposed by Qin *et al*. (2009. [Quantification of spatial gradation of slope positions](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2009.04.003). Geomorphology 110, 152-161.). AutoFuzSlpPos consists three major parts, i.e., preparing topographic attributes, extracting typical locations, and calculating similarity for each slope position. The preliminary implementation employs the system of five basic slope positions, such as Fig.1.

Current version of AutoFuzSlpPos is developed under the [TauDEM parallelized framework](http://hydrology.usu.edu/taudem/taudem5/index.html "TauDEM") and programmed using C++ and Python language. 

The program is capable with Windows and Linux/Unix, e.g., Windows 7/8/10, CentOS 6.2, and Ubuntu 14.04. The  prerequisites environment of the compilation  and configuration of AutoFuzSlpPos is as follows:

- For PC, [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632) (e.g., VS 2010), [Microsoft MS-MPI V6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47259), CMAKE
- For Linux/Unix, GCC 4.7+, MAKE, and MPICH or OpenMPI
- Python 2.7+ packaged with Numpy 1.6+ and GDAL 1.9+.

# 2 Installation

If you want to install from source code, please follow [Compile on Windows](#22-compile-on-windows) or [Compile on Linux/Unix](#23-compile-on-linuxunix). If you want to use AutoFuzSlpPos directly with the compiled executable files, please refers to [Configuration](#24-configuration).

## 2.1 Code structure
The source code consists of two parts: 1) the C++ source code located in `../<source-code>/src`, and 2) python scripts located in `../source-code/py_main`. 

C++ code will be compiled as separated executable files, such as "**SelectTypLocSlpPos**" which is used for extracting typical locations and setting parameters for fuzzy inference of each slope position.
 
Python script is to organize the whole work-flow with a configurable script for users’ customizing optional parameters, such as follows.

| Script | Functionality |
|--------|---------------|
| `main.py`| The entrance of AutoFuzSlpPos |
| `Config.py` | Parse the configuration file (*.ini) prepared by user. |
| `Nomenclature.py` | Predefined filenames |
| `TauDEM.py` | Functions  based  on  TauDEM  and  the  extension  functions,  e.g., SelectTypLocSlpPos |
| `Util.py` | Some fundamental functions, e.g., functions for the Input/Output of raster data |
| `PreProcessing.py` | Preprocessing  for  topographic  attributes,  such  as  relative  position index (RPI), profile curvature |
| `SelectTypLoc.py` | Prepare input files for typical location extraction |
| `FuzzySlpPosInference.py` | Prepare input files for fuzzy inference of each slope position |


## 2.2 Compile on Windows

The MPI library used for PC is [Microsoft MS-MPI V6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47259) or later. 

Firstly, please make sure that CMAKE and nmake (installed with Visual Studio, such as VS2010) have been installed on your PC. It is highly recommended to check the MPI Library path in `../<source-code>/src/CMakeLists.txt` to make sure they are correct for user’s environment:

~~~
include_directories("C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/MPI/Include")
link_directories("C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/MPI/Lib/x86")
link_libraries("C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft SDKs/MPI/Lib/x86/msmpi.lib")
~~~
Then, open “**Visual Studio Command Prompt**” from Start menu (as administrator), and run the following commands:

~~~
cd <Build_Path>
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" <Source_Path>
nmake

e.g.,
cd C:\AutoFuzSlpPos\build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\source-code\src
nmake
~~~

The executable files will be compiled and saved in `<Build_Path>`.

## 2.3 Compile on Linux/Unix

Unlike the MPI version for PC, the implementation of [MPICH](http://www.mpich.org/downloads/ "MPICH") is adopted for Linux/Unix platform.

Firstly, check the MPI Library path in `../<source-code>/src/makefile` to make sure that it is correct for your environment:
~~~
MPI_DIR = /home/zhulj/mpich/
~~~
Then, assign the installation path:
~~~
INSTALLDIR=/home/zhulj/AutoFuzSlpPos/exec_linux
~~~

Lastly, run the following commands:
~~~
cd <Source_Path/src>
make
~~~ 
The executable files will be generated in `INSTALLDIR`.
## 2.4 Configuration

A script program of Python language is implemented to organize the work-flow of deriving fuzzy slope positions.
User can configure the environment of AutoFuzSlpPos through the configuration file with the extension of *.ini, e.g. `.../<source-code>/data/Jamaica_windows.ini` for Windows and `../<source-code>/data/Jamaica_cluster.ini` for Linux cluster.

Besides the required path of the DEM of the study area (i.e., rawdem), the paths of the compiled executable files of AutoFuzSlpPos and workspace to store the results should be given correctly, for instance:

~~~
exeDir = /home/zhulj/AutoFuzSlpPos/exec
rootDir = /home/zhulj/AutoFuzSlpPos/Demo
~~~

Note that, if the path of MPI is in the ENVIRONMENT PATH in the system, the `mpiexeDir` could be set as `None`, otherwise it should be explicitly assigned, such as `mpiexeDir = /home/zhulj/mpich/bin`. The `hostfile` is used to specify the hosts on which the MPI jobs will be submitted. If user does not know how to prepare the hostfile, just leave it as `hostfile = None`. One possible example is as follows:

```
hostfile = /home/zhulj/AutoFuzSlpPos/exec/dgpm
dgpm-cluster.public:1
dgpm-compute-1.local:12
dgpm-compute-2.local:12
dgpm-compute-3.local:12
dgpm-compute-4.local:12
```

Next, the AutoFuzSlpPos with default parameter settings is ready to run for the specific study area. Other optional parameters are briefly introduced in the configuration file (*.ini).

# 3 Run AutoFuzSlpPos

Use the following command to run AutoFuzSlpPos:
```
python .../source-code/code/py_main/main.py -ini <configuration file path> [-proc <process number> -root <workspace path>]
```

where: 
`<configuration file path>` is the full path of the *ini file, e.g. `/home/zhulj/AutoFuzSlpPos/data/Jamaica/Jamaica_dgpm.ini`

`<process number>` is the process number for MPI, which can overwrite the inputProc defined in configuration file.

`<workspace path>` it the workspace path to store the results, which can overwrite rootDir the defined in configuration file.

The following table gives a brief introduction to the result files.

| Result Folder | Introduction |
|---|---|
| FuzzySlpPos | Similarity maps of each slope position, as well as the hardened map of slope positions and the corresponding maximum similarity map |
| DinfpreDir | Intermediate files in preparing topographic attributes |
| Params | GRID  of  topographic  attributes,  including  RPI  (Relative  Position  Index), profile curvature, slope gradient, and HAND (Height Above the Nearest Drainage), by default. |
| Config | Configuration files of the extraction of typical locations and fuzzy inference for each slope positions |
| TypLoc | Typical locations of each slope positions |
| Log | Log files which record information such as runtime, etc. |

Note that in the current implementation a system of five basic slope positions is used, i.e., ridge(RDG), shoulder slope (SHD), backslope (BKS), footslope (FTS), and valley (VLY).
